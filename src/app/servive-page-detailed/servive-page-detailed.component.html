    <div class="card-body">
      <!-- <h5 class="card-title">Interactive Learning in Real-Time</h5> -->
      <p class="card-text">Live classes and webinars are interactive, real-time educational sessions conducted over the
        internet, providing opportunities for direct engagement with instructors and peers.

        Live Classes:
        Live classes are structured, regular sessions where instructors teach a curriculum similar to traditional
        classrooms but online. They allow real-time interaction, questions, and discussions, fostering a collaborative
        learning environment. These classes often utilize video conferencing tools, digital whiteboards, and breakout
        rooms to simulate an in-person classroom experience. They are scheduled at specific times, requiring
        participants to attend at those designated periods.

        Webinars:
        Webinars are typically one-time or occasional online events focused on specific topics, often featuring expert
        speakers or panels. They are designed to disseminate information, share knowledge, or provide training to a
        broad audience. Webinars can include live Q&A sessions, polls, and chat interactions to engage participants.
        They are often used for professional development, industry updates, or educational outreach. Unlike live
        classes, webinars are usually less interactive and more lecture-based, but they provide valuable insights and
        opportunities for learning from industry leaders and specialists.

        Both formats leverage digital technologies to enhance accessibility and convenience, enabling learning and
        professional development from anywhere in the world.</p>
