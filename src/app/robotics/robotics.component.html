          <h3>IR Remote Controlled Robot using Arduino</h3>
          <p>IR Remote Controlled Robot using Arduino is a simple yet effective project that allows a standard IR remote to control a robotic vehicle. This robotic vehicle utilizes an Arduino microcontroller as its core control unit, paired with an infrared (IR) receiver module. The IR receiver detects signals from a standard IR remote, which emits unique IR codes for each button press. These codes are received by the IR module and processed by the Arduino. When a button on the TV remote is pressed, the corresponding IR signal is sent to the Arduino. The microcontroller interprets these signals and translates them into movement commands for the robot, such as moving forward, backward, turning left, or right. The robot's movement is facilitated by motors connected to the Arduino via a motor driver shield or H-bridge. This project demonstrates basic robotics and programming concepts, offering an accessible introduction to remote control technology. It's ideal for educational purposes, hobbyist projects, and as a foundation for more complex IR-controlled robotic systems.</p>
